# Brain parts detection using MRI images
Mathematica project for the detection of various brain parts on MRI brain images. The concepts of image processing and object detection were used to outline the brain areas in the given set of images. The tool was deveoped for later medical use for a fast detection of brain parts on MRI images for various purposes. The content detector was trained using a set of MRI scan images given to us by the [Policlinico di Sant'Orsola](https://www.aosp.bo.it/) of Bologna.
